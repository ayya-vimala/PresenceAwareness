# Presence Awareness

This booklet is based on a retreat given in September 2023 at Dharma Treasure Retreat, Arizona, USA.

## Retreat introduction

During this retreat we will deep dive into our right here right now presence awareness and benevolent heart. Presence Awareness as an insight meditation theme in itself is often called the ‘pointing out’ or ‘direct discovery’ path. Through direct self inquiry we are essentially attempting to discover, or to evoke the recognition of an ever present dimension of our pure being and knowing nature, which is inherently loving and free. We discover we are always already present and aware in any and every experience. We discover that our heart's longing for liberating happiness and freedom from suffering is the unconditional loving compassionate nature of the sentient being itself. So through exploring these more fundamental dimensions of our being in meditation and direct experience, we realize a deeper understanding of our reality and identity, of who and what we really are. This fact of knowing, or pure awareness. This fact of being, of pure presence. The fact of unconditional love and compassion inherent in the heart of a sentient being.
